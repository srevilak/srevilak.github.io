	<h3>Heater for potbellied pigs causes Marana house fire</h3>

	<p>A house fire started by an unattended space heater has left two people and their pets temporarily without a home, authorities said.</p>

	<p>At about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, Northwest Fire District received a 911 call from a pair of residents returned home to find smoke both inside the house and on their back patio. They quickly got their two potbellied pigs and dog safely off the property and waited for firefighters to arrive.</p>

	<p>The home, in the area of 8700 North Painted Feather Drive, was about a mile from a Northwest station, allowing crew to arrive four minutes after the call was made, according to Northwest District Fire spokesman Captain Adam Goldberg.</p>

	<p>Firefighters discovered that the fire started on the back patio and spread into the wall in the living room and bedroom of the home. Crews had the fire under control in less than ten minutes, according to a news release.</p>

	<p>Because of damages to the home, electrical service was disconnected and the residents were displaced until repairs are made. The family and their pets will be staying with friends that live in the area. Damage costs are estimate at $10,000.</p>

	<p>Investigators for Northwest Fire determined that the fire was an accident and started because of a space heater left unattended near combustible items.</p>

	<p>Goldberg said that the owner told them the space heater was used to warm the potbellied pigs&#39; enclosure when the residents were home, and it must have been left on mistakenly when they left the house.</p>

	<p>Northwest Fire reminds everyone to never leave a space heater on while not in the room it&#39;s being used in and to make sure that the area nearby is free from combustibles, like clothes or bedding.</p>
